          <p class="secondary-text">We grew up in downtown Chicago, and we used to play in a band. Jake loves fried
            chicken, and Elwood loves dry white toast.</p>
          <p class="secondary-text">While the band didn't make it, the hard work we put in trying to promote it sure did.
            Like a lot of people, we needed a website, and we needed to rank. The "experts" didn't seem to know what they were talking
            about, so we figured it out on our own.</p>
          <h2 class="secondary-title">I can do all sorts of great stuff</h2>
          <p class="secondary-text">Honestly most people in this industry seem to be full of crap.</p>
          <p class="secondary-text">We don't care what you've heard, or what others
            have told you, we get results and at the end of the day, what else matters? So sure, maybe we're a bit
            different from what you'd expect, but if you want to rank, market, and build your way to the top, we're the brothers
            for you.</p>
